## Week4
- Java APIE: Abstraction (Interface), Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation
### Interface (100% Abstraction) vs Inheritance (extends Parent Class)
- Differences:
  - No Attribute vs Have attribute(s)
  - No Constructor vs Have Constructor(s)
  - Implements >= 1 Interfaces vs Extends ONLY 1 Parent Class
  - Methods are all abstract (before Java 8) vs Contains both abstract & concrete method
  - Not support static variable vs Support ...
- Same:
  - Support Static Final Variable
  - Support Static methods (After Java 8)
  - Suport Default/Inherit instance method (After Java 8)
